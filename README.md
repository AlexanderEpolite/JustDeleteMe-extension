# JustDeleteMe Extension

Unofficial extension of JustDeleteMe for Firefox-based browsers.

Since this uses manifest v2, it is currently not compatible with Chromium-based browsers, but
there is [already an extension for that](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-delete-me/hfpofkfbabpbbmchmiekfnlcgaedbgcf) by Mike Rogers.

# JustDeleteMe Extension

[![Firefox Extension Link](https://ffp4g1ylyit3jdyti1hqcvtb-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/addons/files/2015/11/get-the-addon.png)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/justdeleteme/)

Unofficial extension of JustDeleteMe for Firefox-based browsers.

**This extension is new, there may be some minor quirks or bugs.**  If you find any, create an issue on this GitHub repository.

Since this uses manifest v2, it is currently not compatible with Chromium-based browsers, but
there is [already an extension for that](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/just-delete-me/hfpofkfbabpbbmchmiekfnlcgaedbgcf) by Mike Rogers.
